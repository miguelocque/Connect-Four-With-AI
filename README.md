# Connect-Four-With-AI
This Connect Four game was built in Python using Object-Oriented Programming to encapsulate key components such as the Board, Player, and AIPlayer classes. The AI uses a look-ahead minimax strategy, temporarily simulating possible moves to rank their effectiveness based on the current board state. The AI performs optimally with a lookahead depth of 5 or 6; beyond that (e.g., depth â‰¥ 7), performance becomes noticeably slower due to the exponential growth of the search tree.
